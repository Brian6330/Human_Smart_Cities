\begin{abstract}
This package, \textsf{unifrsr}, allows the easy creation of seminar
reports using standard \LaTeX. It should be the last
package loaded, to ensure that nothing overrides the page layout.

Note that utility commands are available: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb+\seminartitle+ which specifies, optionally, the title of the seminar the report is being written for
\item \verb+\supervisor+ which specifies the name of the professor supervisor of the project
\item \verb+\assistant+ which specifies, optionally, the name of the assistants of the seminar, separated by the command \verb+\and+
\end{itemize}

\keywords{Seminar report, Human-IST Research Institute}
